Need a high quality screenshot to share an interesting site? This app uses the ApiFlash API to take screenshots of a given website with a variety of parameters. First, you will sign up for an ApiFlash account and explore the query builder that allows you to test out queries. Then, you will try making a single static API call from your site. Then, you will build out an interface that allows you to get your own screenshots and insert them into the page.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Allow the user to add at least three parameters to a query to the ApiFlash API**
- [x] **Display the screenshot returned by the ApiFlash call on the page**
- [x] **On a separate part of the page, display all the images the user has queried thus far**

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Display whether or not your web app has hit the maximum number of queries allowed using another API call
